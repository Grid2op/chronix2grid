    .. warning::
        You should not start this function twice. Before starting a new run, make sure the previous one has terminated (otherwise you might
        erase some previously generated scenario)

    Parameters
    ----------
    env : _type_
        The grid2op environment
    seed:
        The seed to use (the same seed is guaranteed to generate the same scenarios)
    nb_scenario: ``int``
        The number of scenarios to generate
    nb_core: ``int``
        The number of core you want to use (to speed up the generation process)
    with_loss: ``bool``
        Do you make sure that the generated data will not be modified too much when running with grid2op (default = True).
        Setting it to False will speed up (by quite a lot) the generation process, but will degrade the data quality.
